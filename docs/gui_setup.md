# GUI Setup

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Navigate to `gui` folder and run `npm install` (requires internet). This installs
   all dependencies including **ts-node**, which is required for starting
   Electron from the TypeScript entry point.
3. Launch development mode with `npm run start`.
4. Build the desktop app with `npm run make`.
